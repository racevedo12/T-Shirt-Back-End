    description:
      "The modern Gold American Eagle series began in 1986. The obverse side is that of Lady Liberty created by Augustus Saint Gaudens, the design used for the 1907-1933 $20.00 US Double Eagle gold coin. Because the random year SKU can contain both type one and type two Gold Eagles, the coinâ€™s reverse could depict one of two designs. The original reverse design features the classic heraldic eagle found on all silver and gold eagles since its inception in 1986. The new design, implemented in mid-2021 features a portrait of a single bald eagle intensely staring ahead, created by artist Jennie Norris.",

It wasnâ€™t until 1982 that the mint switched to using .9999 purity gold in itâ€™s coins. This was also the first year they released the Maple Leaf Coin as a fractional 1/10 oz coin.",
